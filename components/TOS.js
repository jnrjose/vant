      <h4>CHANGE TO SERVICE</h4>
      <p style={{ marginBottom: "5rem" }}>
        We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any service
        or material we provide via Service, in our sole discretion without
        notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of
        Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time,
        we may restrict access to some parts of Service, or the entire Service,
        to users, including registered users.
      </p>
      <h4>AMMENDMENT TO TERMS</h4>
      <p style={{ marginBottom: "5rem" }}>
        We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this
        site. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.
        <br />
        <br />
        Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of revised
        Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected
        to check this page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they
        are binding on you.
        <br />
        <br />
        By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become
        effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not
        agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use Service.
      </p>
      <h4>WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY</h4>
      <p style={{ marginBottom: "5rem" }}>
        We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this
        site. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.
        <br />
        <br />
        No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall
        be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a
        waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Company to
        assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of
        such right or provision.
        <br />
        <br />
        If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of
        competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any
        reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum
        extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full
        force and effect.
      </p>
